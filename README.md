## About 
Greetings! I'm Felipe from Brazil and I have worked as a Software Developer for the past 4 years now. I am currently employed as a Front-End developer using Angular for a bank here in Brazil.

I've been also lately exploring Svelte which by the way happens to be pretty cool. React Native for mobile apps is on my radar too and I actually created a small project here using it. From time to time, I play with Node/Express and MongoDB and I tend to create my APIs based on that stack.

I usually chill out by watching movies/tv shows and listening to some rock music. Travelling when it's possible is something that me and my family definitely love doing too. Also pretty keen on games.

Some of the stuff that I do for fun, you can check down below.
