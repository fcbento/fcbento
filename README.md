## About 
Greetings! I'm Felipe from Brazil and I have worked as a Software Developer for the past 4 years now. I am currently employed as a Front-End developer using Angular for a bank here in Brazil. Graduted from the university with a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems. 

Been also exploring Svelte which by the way happens to be pretty cool. React Native for mobile apps is on my radar too and I actually created a small project here using it. From time to time, I play with Node/Express and MongoDB and I tend to create my APIs based on that stack.

I usually chill out by watching movies/tv shows and listening to some rock music. Travelling when it's possible is something that me and my family definitely love doing too. Also pretty keen on games.
