## About 
Greetings! I'm Felipe from Brazil, and I have worked as a Software Developer for the past 5 years. Currently, I am employed as a Front-End developer using Angular for a bank here in Brazil. I graduated from the university with a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems.

I have also been exploring Svelte, which happens to be pretty cool. React Native for mobile apps is on my radar too, and I have actually created a small project using it. From time to time, I play with Node/Express and MongoDB, and I tend to create my APIs based on that stack.

In my free time, I usually chill out by watching movies/tv shows and listening to some rock/metal music. Travelling, when it's possible, is something that my family and I definitely love doing. I'm also pretty keen on games.

Feel free to reach out to me anytime. Feedback is always welcome. You can find more about me on my Linktree, Instagram, and LinkedIn profiles.
