### About 
Greetings! I'm Felipe from Brazil, and I have worked as a Software Developer for the past 6 years now. I am currently employed as a Front-End developer using Angular for a bank here in Brazil. I graduated from the university with a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems in 2015.

I have also been exploring some other front-end frameworks like Svelte, React and I usually give Node.js a try for back-end development. React Native for mobile stuff is on my radar too, and I have actually created a small project using it. From time to time, I play with Node/Express and MongoDB, and I tend to create my APIs based on that stack.

I really like writing in English and I honestly tend to write most of the things I do here in English, which is a good way to practice. There might be a thing or two in Portuguese though. 

In my free time, I usually chill out by watching movies, tv shows and listening to some rock music. Travelling is something that my family and I definitely love doing too. I'm also pretty keen on games, especially RPG games.

I'm a husband and father of two little boys!

Feel free to reach me out anytime. You can always find out more about me down below.
