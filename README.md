## About 
Greetings! I'm Felipe from Brazil and I have worked as a Software Developer for the past 3 years now. I am currently employed as a Front-End developer using Angular on a microservices based application that uses Java/Spring Boot. 

I've been lately also exploring Svelte which by the way happens to be pretty cool and a bit of React as well. React Native for mobile apps is on my radar too and I actually created a small project here using it. From time to time I play with Node/Express and MongoDB and I usually tend to create my APIs based on that stack.

I usually chill out by watching movies / tv shows and listening to some rock/metal music. Travelling when it's possible is something that me and my family definitely love doing. Also pretty keen on games.

Feedback is always welcome and feel free to reach me out anytime :)
